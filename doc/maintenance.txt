Several types of maintenance work has to happen inside alba

1) message delivery (from albamgr to osds & nsm hosts)
2) check if available osds are claimed by another env
3) rebalancing data (when new nodes/disks are added)
4) repairing decommissioned disks
5) cleaning up obsolete fragments
6) garbage collecting fragments written by dead (or extremely slow) clients
7) repair by policy (upgrade objects written with a narrow policy to wider policies when applicable)
8) diverse work items (cleanup osds/namespaces, repair object for which a bad fragment was detected, ...)


This work can be executed by 1 or more maintenance agents.
We try not to have 2 maintenance agents perform the same work.
This requires a bit of coordination.

2 concepts are introduced
- maintenance master
- position (number) of the maintenance process (e.g. 7 of 9)


Tasks 1, 2 & 8 are only performed by the maintenance master.
Task 4 is performed by all maintenance agents. They don't run into each
others way due to how they select which objects to repair.
Tasks 3, 5, 6 & 7 are divided amongst the several agents based on the namespace_id.
